# Quantumania-SoC-2024
Seasons of Code 2024 repository for a project on Quantum Computing and Quantum Cryptography
Mentors: [Lakshya Gadhwal](https://github.com/DarthVishnu8) and [Yug Agarwal](https://github.com/yug1919)

## Learning Objectives
* Get a good understanding of the difference between Classical and Quantum Computers.
* Understand important quantum protocols.
* Design and implement quantum circuits and algorithms.

## Resources
The main resource that we will follow in this project will be the holy grail, "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Nielsen and Chuang along with some research papers. For the coding part refer to [IBM Qiskit's documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit)
