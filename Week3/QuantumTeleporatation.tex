\section{Quantum Teleportation}
The task is to teleport an arbitrary qubit state $\ket{\psi} = \alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}$ from Alice to Bob with the help of only classical communication and a previously shared EPR state $\ket{\Phi^+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00} + \ket{11})$ (each having one qubit). The teleportation protocol consists of four main steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Alice applies a CNOT gate on her two qubits, with $\ket{\psi}$ as the control qubit and her half of the entangled pair as the target qubit. She then applies a Hadamard gate to the control qubit.
    \item Alice measures both qubits that she owns. She sends the measurement results to Bob.
    \item Depending on the measurement results, Bob applies $X$ and $Z$ gates to his qubit.
    \item The qubit in Bob's possession is now in the state $\ket{\psi}$.
\end{enumerate}
