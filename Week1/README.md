# Warmup and Background
This week's agenda is to get familiar with the notions of Linear Algebra and get some background in Quantum Mechanics to get warmed up for the rest of the project.

Reading Material: Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the book "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Nielsen and Chuang.

The assignment for this week will be released shortly.
